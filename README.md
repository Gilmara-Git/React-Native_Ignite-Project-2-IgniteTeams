# About

**React Native** project developed during my **Ignite bootcamp** with [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).

- This an an application to manage and organize games with your friends.
- All the components, screens and functionalities are well structured into proper folders separating functionalities and responsibilities.
- It allows you to create a ***group***, then add ***players*** into its Teams.
- It does not allow to register the same ***player*** in 2 different Teams.
- There is a label indicating how many ***players*** contain in each Team.
- There are validations to prevent entering duplicated or blank ***groups*** and/or a ***players***.
- You are prompted to an alert message to confirm whenever you want to remove a ***group*** and/or a ***player***.
  
 # Motivation

- Learn how to style the interfaces/components using the **lib styled components** for react native.
- Learn how to work with ***AsyncStorage*** to persist data in the users's device. ( ***AsyncStorage.setItem()*** , ***AsyncStorage.getItem()*** and ***AsyncStorage.removeItem()*** were used to manipulate data).
- Practice ***React Navigation v6*** (***Stack Navigation*** was used)
- Interact with the Dev Community, learn together and progress as a Developer.
- Keep committed with my goals.</br>
