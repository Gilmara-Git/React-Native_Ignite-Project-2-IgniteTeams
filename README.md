- You can join a Group and from within the Group,  a Team

From here and on, continue editing ...... 
- You can toggle a task as completed/uncompleted
- There are 2 labels showing how many tasks are created and how many are completed
- Whenever a task is completed, there will be a change on its text style.
- There are validations to prevent entering duplicated or blank tasks.
- You are prompted to an alert message to confirm whenever you want to remove a task.
  ##Beyond:
- Added a **congratulations** page whenever all tasks are marked as completed.
